Cancer specialist across the country are uttering words that we have dreamed of – ”Amazing”, “Exciting”, “Pretty Remarkable”. All because of a new treatment and handful of people was stunning successful outcome. It is being called the most significant advance in cancer research in decade. It’s only been tried in 3 leukemia patients so far. All of them are in advanced stages of the disease with few other treatment options. The University of Pennsylvania’s experiment created armies of what they called “serial killer cells”. Blood was taken from each patient and the T cells, the body uses to fight disease, removed. Scientists then inserted a modified harmless version of HIV into those cells. And millions of those genetically engineered cells were then injected into the patients. Their intent was to use the patient’s own blood cells to kill their cancer cells – it worked. They targeted cancer cells – not only destroying the existing cancer, but new cancer as it emerges. Principle working on decades.

For two weeks, there was no change in the patients. But then they became violently ill with extreme flu symptoms. This was a sign the therapy was working. 1 year after treatment, two of the patients are still cancer free, and the third has improved. The goal now is to find out how long these remissions last.
Engineer cells hang around the body sometime – could be helpful or harmful.

Scientists are already preparing to try the same technique to treat other kinds of cancer, including pancreatic, ovarian, prostate, and even brain cancer.
